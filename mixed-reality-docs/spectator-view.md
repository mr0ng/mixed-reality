# Spectator View for HoloLens and HoloLens 2

![Marker](images/SpecViewPhoneHero.jpg)

## Overview

When wearing a HoloLens, we often forget that a person who does not have it on is unable to experience the wonders that we can. Spectator View allows others to see on a 2D screen what a HoloLens user sees in their world.
Spectator View offers a fast and affordable approach to recording holograms in HD with mobile devices. It also offers a professional quality recording of holograms with video cameras.

## Key Resources

* [**Spectator View on GitHub**](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-SpectatorView)
* [**Architecture**](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-SpectatorView/blob/master/doc/SpectatorView.Architecture.md)
* [**Samples**](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-SpectatorView/tree/master/samples)
* [**Mobile Setup Instructions**](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-SpectatorView/blob/master/doc/SpectatorView.Setup.md)
* [**Video Camera Setup Instructions**](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-SpectatorView/blob/master/doc/SpectatorView.Setup.VideoCamera.md)

## Use Cases
* You can record a mixed reality experience using an iPhone or Android device. Record in full HD and apply anti-aliasing to holograms and even shadows. It is a cost-effective and quick way to capture video of holograms.
* Stream live mixed reality experiences to an Apple TV directly from your iPhone or iPad, lag-free!
* Share the experience with guests: Let non-HoloLens users experience holograms directly from their phones or tablets.

## Current Features

* Spatial synchronization of Holograms, so everyone sees holograms in the exact same place.
* iOS (ARKit-enabled devices) and Android (ARCore-enabled devices) support.
Multiple iOS guests.
Recording of video + holograms + ambient sound + hologram sound.
Share sheet so you can save video, email it, or share with other supporting apps.
