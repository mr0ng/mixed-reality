# 2. Saving, retrieving, and sharing Azure Spatial Anchors

In this tutorial, we will learn how to save our Azure Spatial Anchors across multiple app sessions by saving our anchor information to the HoloLens 2's disk. We will also learn how to share this anchor information to other devices for a multi-device anchor alignment.

## Objectives

* Learn how to save and retrieve Azure Spatial Anchor information from the HoloLens 2 local disk, for persistence between app sessions

* Learn how to share Azure Spatial Anchor information between users in a multi-device scenario

## Instructions

### Persist Azure Anchors Between App Sessions - Save Anchor ID to Disk

1. Search for and add the SaveAnchorToDisk prefab to your scene. These include two buttons, one button for saving any available Azure Anchor IDs to the HoloLens 2 disk, and another for retrieving any IDs from the disk.

2. Configure Each button according to the instructions below

   - For the Button named SaveToDisk, create a new event under the Button Pressed event trigger as well as the On Click event trigger. Drag the ParentAnchor object into the empty field, and assign the SaveAzureAnchorIDToDisk() method from the ParentAnchor Object's ASAmoduleScript component.
   
     > Note: some of the buttons may appear overlapping the other buttons in the scene. Feel free to adjust the button's positioning.

   - For the Button named GetFromDisk, create a new event under the Button Pressed event trigger as well as the On Click event trigger. Drag the ParentAnchor object into the empty field, and assign the LoadAzureAnchorIDsFromDisk() method from the ParentAnchor Object's ASAmoduleScript component.

3. Follow the instructions from Tutorial 1 to build the updated application to your device. After pressing the Create Azure Anchor button, as you did in the previous lesson, you may now save the Azure Anchor ID to disk by pressing the save to disk button.

4. Restart the application, start the Azure Session, Press Load Anchor ID, and then press Locate Azure Anchor to locate the anchor associated with the ID we saved to the disk. The entire scene should now snap into position, at the location you saved the anchor previously!

### Share Azure Anchors between multiple devices

In this section, we'll learn how to share the Azure Anchor ID between multiple devices. This will allow multiple devices to query Azure for the same anchor ID, allowing our anchored holograms and scenes to be spatially aligned. Spatial alignment (seeing the same holograms in the same physical location between multiple devices) is key to local shared experiences in the HoloLens 2. There are many ways to transfer information regarding azure IDs between devices, including methods outlined in the Azure Spatial Anchors shared experiences [Tutorials](mrlearning-sharing(photon)-ch1.md) This example uses a simple web service to upload and download Anchor IDs between devices.

1. Add the ShareAnchor prefab into your hierarchy. This prefab adds two new buttons to your scene; one for uploading anchor ID information and another for downloading anchor ID information.

2. Configure Each button according to the instructions below

   - For the Button named, SendSharedAnchor, create a new event under the Button Pressed event trigger as well as the On Click event trigger. Drag the ParentAnchor object into the empty field, and assign the ShareAnchor() method from the ParentAnchor Object's ASAmoduleScript component.

   - For the Button named, GetSharedAnchor, create a new event under the Button Pressed event trigger as well as the On Click event trigger. Drag the ParentAnchor object into the empty field, and assign the GetSharedAzureAnchor() method from the ParentAnchor object's ASAmoduleScript component.

3. Follow the instructions from [Tutorial 1](mrlearning-base-ch1.md). to build the updated application to your device. After pressing the Create Azure Anchor button, as you did in the previous lesson, you may now share the Azure Anchor ID to other devices by pressing the Share To Other Device button.

   > Note: Select the parent anchor and scroll down to the parent anchor script. Ensure that your public sharing pin is unique, so that when you share it, you know it is yours that you are sharing. There could be thousands of users sharing their Azure anchors, so doing this will allow you to ensure you are sharing the correct Azure anchors.

4. If you have another HoloLens 2 device, start the application and then start the Azure Session. Press the Get Shared Anchor ID button, and then press the Locate Azure Anchor button to locate the anchor associated with the ID we saved to the disk. The entire scene should now snap into position, at the where it was placed on the other HoloLens 2 device! If you only have one HoloLens 2, you may still test functionality by restarting the application, starting the Azure Session, and then Press the "Get Shared Anchor ID" button button, and then press the Locate Azure Anchor button to locate the anchor associated with the ID we saved to the disk. The entire scene should now snap into position, at the location you saved the anchor previously!

## Congratulations
In this Lesson you learned how to persist Azure Spatial Anchors between application sessions and application restarts by saving the Azure Spatial Anchor ID to the local disk on HoloLens 2. You also learned how to share Azure Spatial Anchors between multiple devices for a basic multi-user, static hologram shared experience.

We learn how to implement Azure Spatial Anchors as part of a fully interactive local shared experience during the final lesson of the Sharing Module. A local sharing experience may include functionality such as synchronized 3D object position, rotation, and scale, identifiers for each user, and shared application states. Azure Spatial Anchors enhances these shared scenarios by providing each participant with a common anchor that lets all users see virtual objects in the same physical location. This is true across a range of device platforms, including HoloLens, Android, and iOS devices. To learn how to develop a shared experience, complete all lessons in the Sharing module.

In the next Lesson, we will learn how to provide users with real-time feedback. This feedback will include information about Anchor creation, the quality of environment understanding, and the state of the Azure session. Without feedback, users may not know whether an anchor has successfully been upload to Azure, whether the quality of the environment is sufficient for anchor creation, or the current state.
