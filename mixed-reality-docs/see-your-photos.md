# See your photos on HoloLens

When you take [mixed reality photos and videos](mixed-reality-capture.md) on HoloLens, they are saved to the "Camera roll" folder. The built-in Photos app can be used to view, manage, and share photos and videos. You can also install the [OneDrive app](https://www.microsoft.com/p/onedrive/9wzdncrfj1p3) from the Microsoft Store to sync photos to other devices. 

## Photos app

The Photos app is one of the default apps on the Start menu, and comes built-in with HoloLens. You can learn more about using the Photos app to view content and place it in your physical environment [on the HoloLens support site](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12648). 

## OneDrive app

With [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/) you can access, manage, and share your photos and videos with any device and with any user. To access the photos and videos captured on HoloLens, first download the [OneDrive app](https://www.microsoft.com/p/onedrive/9wzdncrfj1p3) from the Microsoft Store on your HoloLens. Then open the OneDrive app and select **Settings > Camera upload**, and turn on **Camera upload**.

## USB 

If your HoloLens is running the [Windows 10 April 2018 update](release-notes-april-2018.md) or later, you can connect your HoloLens to a Windows 10 PC over USB to browse photos and videos on the device using MTP (media transfer protocol). You'll need to make sure the device is unlocked to browse files if you have a PIN or password set up on your device. 

## Windows Device Portal

If you have enabled the [Windows Device Portal](using-the-windows-device-portal.md#mixed-reality-capture), you can use it to browse, retrieve, and manage the photos and videos stored on your device.
