# Release notes - August 2016

The HoloLens team is listening to feedback from developers in the Windows Insider Program to prioritize our work. Please continue to [give us feedback](give-us-feedback.md) through the Feedback Hub, the [developer forums](https://forums.hololens.com) and [Twitter via @HoloLens](https://twitter.com/hololens). As Windows 10 embraces the Anniversary Update, the HoloLens team is happy to deliver further improve to the holographic experience. In this update, we focused on major fixes, improvements, and introducing features requested by businesses and available in the Microsoft HoloLens Commercial Suite.

**Latest release:** Windows Holographic August 2016 Update (**10.0.14393.0**, Windows 10 Anniversary Release)

To [update to the current release](updating-hololens.md), open the *Settings* app, go to *Update & Security*, then select the *Check for updates* button.

## New features

**Attach To Process Debugging**
 HoloLens now supports attach-to-process debugging. You can use Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 to connect to a running app on a HoloLens and [start debugging it](using-visual-studio.md#debugging-an-installed-or-running-app). This works without the need to deploy from a Visual Studio project.

**Updated HoloLens Emulator**
 We've also released an updated version of the HoloLens Emulator.

**Gamepad Support**
 You can now pair and use Bluetooth gamepads with HoloLens! The newly released Xbox Wireless Controller S features Bluetooth capabilities and can be used to play your favorite gamepad-enabled games and apps. A [controller update](http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter) must be applied before you can connect the Xbox Wireless Controller S with HoloLens. The Xbox Wireless Controller S is supported by [XInput](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh405053(v=vs.85).aspx) and [Windows.Gaming.Input](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.gaming.input.aspx) APIs. Additional models of Bluetooth controllers may be accessed through the [Windows.Gaming.Input](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.gaming.input.aspx) API.
