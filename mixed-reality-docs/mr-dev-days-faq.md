# Mixed Reality Dev Days FAQ

* **Who should apply? Is there criteria?**
    
    We’re passionate about welcoming a diverse developer community to Mixed Reality Dev Days. We’re also ensuring this event brings together developers from our large customers and partners, large studios, small studios, and individual developers.

    If you are a mixed reality developer looking to get training on our developer platform, tools, services and devices, we encourage you to join us at Mixed Reality Dev Days.

    Our aim is to have a wide range of mixed reality developers and designers in attendance, and any info you can provide in the [application](https://aka.ms/MRDevDayApplication) will help us to make sure this happens.

* **When will I know if I can attend?**

    [Applications](https://aka.ms/MRDevDayApplication) are open until noon PST on April 5, 2019. Depending on when you complete your application, you may be notified of your status as soon as April 5, 2019. We’re working hard to ensure all applicants are notified of their status by end of day on April 10, 2019. If we do not fill all the spots from this first wave of applicants, we may open applications for a second wave.

* **Why do I have to apply?**

    We have received high interest in this event and have a maximum capacity for the event. For this reason, we’re asking that all developers interested complete this [application](https://aka.ms/MRDevDayApplication) so that we learn more about what you’re working on and why you’re interested.

* **What's the difference between Mixed Reality Dev Days and Build?**

    We designed Mixed Reality Dev Days for YOU – experts in mixed reality and the many aspects of cloud and AI technology that come with it, from computer vision to hologram creation. If you are a mixed reality developer looking to get training on our developer platform, tools, services and devices, Mixed Reality Dev Days is a great fit. 

    [Microsoft Build](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/build) brings developers and experts from product teams across the company together. A wide range of technologies and application patterns are covered. This event does not replace Build, and if that’s your jam, we encourage you to do that, too! 

* **How much does the event cost?**

    This event is free to attend.

* **What costs am I responsible for?**

    You are responsible for travel expenses (flight, hotel, meals, transportation to and from).

* **What should I expect?**

    Mixed Reality Dev Days has a heavy developer focus (around 75%) supplemented by business development and strategic insights (around 25%).  You’ll have a chance to code alongside our developers, demo the latest in our portfolio, and learn about the science behind our tech, plus best practices and lessons we learned over the years.

* **Do I need to bring my own developer machine?**

    Yes, each participant should bring their own developer PCs installed with the software, tools and IDEs you’re using for your environment.

* **Where can I learn more?**

    You can find more on our [Mixed Reality Documentation pages](mr-dev-days.md), and you can always reach out to our Mixed Reality Developer Relations team with questions.
