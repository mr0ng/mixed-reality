# Mixed reality capture for developers

> [NOTE!]
> See [Render from the PV camera](#render-from-the-pv-camera-opt-in) below for guidance on a new MRC capability for HoloLens 2.

Since a user could take a [mixed reality capture](mixed-reality-capture.md) (MRC) photo or video at any time, there are a few things that you should keep in mind when developing your application. This includes best practices for MRC visual quality and being responsive to system changes while MRCs are being captured.

Developers can also seamlessly integrate mixed reality capture and insertion into their apps.

MRC on HoloLens (first-generation) supports videos and photos up to 720p, while MRC on HoloLens 2 supports videos up to 1080p and photos up to 4K resolution.

## The importance of quality MRC

Mixed reality captured photos and videos are likely the first exposure a user will have of your app. Whether as mixed reality screenshots on your Microsoft Store page or from other users sharing MRCs on social networks. You can use MRC to demo your app, educate users, encourage users to share their mixed world interactions, and for user research and problem solving.

## How MRC impacts your app

### Enabling MRC in your app

By default, an app does not have to do anything to enable users to take mixed reality captures.

### Enabling improved alignment for MRC in your app

By default, mixed reality capture combines the right eye's holographic output with the photo/video (PV) camera. These two sources are combined using the focus point set by the currently running immersive app.

This means that holograms outside the focus plane won't align as well (due to the physical distance between the PV camera and the right display).

#### Set the focus point

Immersive apps (on HoloLens) should set the [focus point](focus-point-in-unity.md) of where they want their stabilization plane to be. This ensures the best alignment in both the headset and in mixed reality capture.

If a focus point is not set, the stabilization plane will default to two meters.

#### Render from the PV camera (opt-in)

HoloLens 2 adds the ability for an immersive app to **render from the PV camera** while mixed reality capture is running. To ensure the app supports the additional render correctly, the app has to opt-in to this functionality.

Render from the PV camera offers the following improvements over the default MRC experience:
* Hologram alignment to both your physical environment and hands (for near interactions) should be accurate at all distances, instead of having an offset at distances other than the focus point as you might see in the default MRC.
* The right eye in the headset won't be compromised, as it won't be used to render the holograms for the MRC output.

There are three steps to enable rendering from the PV camera:
1. Enable the PhotoVideoCamera HolographicViewConfiguration
2. Handle the additional HolographicCamera render
3. Verify your shaders and code render correctly from this additional HolographicCamera

##### Enable the PhotoVideoCamera HolographicViewConfiguration

To opt-in, an app simply enables the PhotoVideoCamera's [HolographicViewConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Graphics.Holographic.HolographicViewConfiguration):
```csharp
var display = Windows.Graphics.Holographic.HolographicDisplay.GetDefault();
var view = display.TryGetViewConfiguration(Windows.Graphics.Holographic.HolographicViewConfiguration.PhotoVideoCamera);
if (view != null)
{
   view.IsEnabled = true;
}
```

##### Handle the additional HolographicCamera render in DirectX

When the app has opt-in to render from the PV camera and mixed reality capture starts:
1. HolographicSpace's CameraAdded event will fire. This event can be deferred if the app cannot handle the camera at this time.
2. Once the event has completed (and there are no outstanding deferrals) the HolographicCamera will appear in the next HolographicFrame's AddedCameras list.

When mixed reality capture stops (or if the app disables the view configuration while mixed reality capture is running): the HolographicCamera will appear in the next HolographicFrame's RemovedCameras list and the HolographicSpace's CameraRemoved event will fire.

A [ViewConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.graphics.holographic.holographiccamera.viewconfiguration) property has been added to HolographicCamera to help identify the configuration a camera belongs to.

##### Handle the additional HolographicCamera render in Unity

>[!NOTE]
> Unity support to render from the PV camera is under development and can't be used, yet. This documentation will be updated when a build of Unity with support for rendering from the PV camera is available.

##### Verify shaders and code support additional cameras

Run a mixed reality capture and check for unusual alignment, missing content, or performance issues. Update shaders and code as appropriate.

If there are certain scenes that cannot support rendering to an additional camera, you can disable the PhotoVideoCamera's HolographicViewConfiguration during them.

### Disabling MRC in your app

#### 2D app

2D apps can choose to have their visual content obscured when mixed reality capture is running by:
* Present with the [DXGI_PRESENT_RESTRICT_TO_OUTPUT](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3ddxgi/dxgi-present) flag
* Create the app's swap chain with the [DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_FLAG_HW_PROTECTED](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dxgi/ne-dxgi-dxgi_swap_chain_flag) flag
* With the Windows 10 May 2019 Update, setting ApplicationView's [IsScreenCaptureEnabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.viewmanagement.applicationview.isscreencaptureenabled)

#### Immersive app

Immersive apps can choose to have their visual content excluded from mixed reality capture by:
* Setting HolographicCameraRenderingParameter's [IsContentProtectionEnabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.graphics.holographic.holographiccamerarenderingparameters.iscontentprotectionenabled) to disable mixed reality capture for its associated frame
* Setting HolographicCamera's [IsHardwareContentProtectionEnabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.graphics.holographic.holographiccamera.ishardwarecontentprotectionenabled) to disable mixed reality capture for its associated holographic camera

#### Password Keyboard

With the Windows 10 May 2019 Update, visual content is automatically excluded from mixed reality capture when a password or pin keyboard is visible.

### Knowing when MRC is active

The [AppCapture](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Capture.AppCapture) class can be used by an app to know when system mixed reality capture is running (for either audio or video).

>[!NOTE]
>AppCapture's [GetForCurrentView](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.media.capture.appcapture.getforcurrentview) API can return null if mixed reality capture isn't available on the device. It's also important to de-register the CapturingChanged event when your app is suspended, otherwise MRC can get into a blocked state.

### Best practices (HoloLens-specific)

MRC is expected to work without additional work from developers, but there are a few things to be aware of to provide the best mixed reality capture experience of your app.

**MRC uses the hologram’s alpha channel to blend with the [camera](locatable-camera.md) imagery**

The most important step is to make sure your app is clearing to transparent black instead of clearing to opaque black. In Unity, this is done by default with the MixedRealityToolkit but if you are developing in non-Unity, you may need to make a one line change.

Here are some of the artifacts you might see in MRC if your app is not clearing to transparent black:

**Example Failures**: Black edges around the content (failing to clear to transparent black)

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="images/chessboardblackedges-300px.jpg" alt="Failing to clear to transparent black: black edge artifacts around holograms"/>
</td>
<td>
<img src="images/fieldblackedges-300px.jpg" alt="Failing to clear to transparent black: black edge artifacts around holograms"/>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Example Failures**: The entire background scene of the hologram appears black. Setting a background alpha value of 1 results in a black background

![Setting a background alpha value of 1 results in a black background](images/clearopaqueblack-300px.png)

**Expected Result**: Holograms appear properly blended with the real-world (expected result if clearing to transparent black)

![Expected result if clearing to transparent black](images/cleartransparentblack-300px.png)

**Solution**:
* Change any content that is showing up as opaque black to have an alpha value of 0.
* Ensure that the app is clearing to transparent black.
* Unity defaults to clear to clear automatically with the MixedRealityToolkit, but if it’s a non-Unity app you should modify the color used with ID3D11DeiceContext::ClearRenderTargetView(). You want to ensure you clear to transparent black (0,0,0,0) instead of opaque black (0,0,0,1).

You can now tune the alpha values of your assets if you’d like, but typically don’t need to. Most of the time, MRCs will look good out of the box. MRC assumes pre-multiplied alpha. The alpha values will only affect the MRC capture.

### What to expect when MRC is enabled on HoloLens

The following apply to both HoloLens (first-generation) and HoloLens 2, unless otherwise noted:

* The system will throttle the application to 30Hz rendering. This creates some headroom for MRC to run so the app doesn’t need to keep a constant budget reserve and also matches the MRC video record framerate of 30fps
* Hologram content in the right eye of the device may appear to “sparkle” when recording/streaming MRC: text may become more difficult to read and hologram edges may appear more jaggy (opting-in to 3rd camera render on **HoloLens 2** avoids this compromise)
* MRC photos and videos will respect the application’s [focus point](focus-point-in-unity.md) if the application has enabled it, which will help ensure holograms are accurately positioned. For videos, the Focus Point is smoothed so holograms may appear to slowly drift into place if the Focus Point depth changes significantly. Holograms that are at different depths from the focus point may appear offset from the real world (see example below where Focus Point is set at 2 meters but hologram is positioned at 1 meter).

![Holograms at 2 meters will appear perfectly registered to the world. Holograms at close or far distances may be slightly offset.](images/hologramaccuracydistancemrc-1000px.png)

## Integrating MRC functionality from within your app

Your mixed reality app can initiate MRC photo or video capture from within the app, and the content captured is made available to your app without being stored to the device's "Camera roll." You can create a custom MRC recorder or take advantage of built-in camera capture UI. 

### MRC with built-in camera UI

Developers can use the *[Camera Capture UI API](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/capture-photos-and-video-with-cameracaptureui)* to get a user-captured mixed reality photo or video with just a few lines of code.

This API launches the built-in MRC camera UI, from which the user can take a photo or video, and returns the resulting capture to your app.  If you want to create your own camera UI, or need lower-level access to the capture stream, you can create a custom Mixed Reality Capture recorder.

### Creating a custom MRC recorder

While the user can always trigger a photo or video using the system MRC capture service, an application may want to build a custom camera app but include holograms in the camera stream just like MRC. This allows the application to kick off captures on behalf of the user, build custom recording UI, or customize MRC settings to name a few examples.

**HoloStudio adds a custom MRC camera using MRC effects**

![HoloStudio adds a custom MRC camera using MRC effects](images/cameraiconholostudio-300px.jpg)

Unity Applications should see [Locatable_camera_in_Unity](locatable-camera-in-unity.md) for the property to enable holograms.

Other applications can do this by using the [Windows Media Capture APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Capture.MediaCapture) to control the Camera and add an MRC Video and Audio effect to include virtual holograms and application audio in stills and videos.

Applications have two options to add the effect:
* The older API: [Windows.Media.Capture.MediaCapture.AddEffectAsync()](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.media.capture.mediacapture.addeffectasync)
* The new Microsoft recommended API (returns an object, making it possible to manipulate dynamic properties): [Windows.Media.Capture.MediaCapture.AddVideoEffectAsync()](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.media.capture.mediacapture.addvideoeffectasync) / [Windows.Media.Capture.MediaCapture.AddAudioEffectAsync()](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.media.capture.mediacapture.addaudioeffectasync) which require the app create its own implementation of [IVideoEffectDefinition](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Effects.IVideoEffectDefinition) and [IAudioEffectDefinition](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.media.effects.iaudioeffectdefinition). Please see the MRC effect sample for sample usage.

>[!NOTE]
> The Windows.Media.MixedRealityCapture namespace will not be recognized by Visual Studio, but the strings are still valid.

### Simultaneous MRC limitations

There are certain limitations around multiple apps accessing MRC at the same time.

#### Photo/video camera access

The photo/video camera is limited to the number of processes that can access it at the same time. While a process is recording video or taking a photo any other process will fail to acquire the photo/video camera. (this applies to both Mixed Reality Capture and standard photo/video capture)

With HoloLens 2, an app can use MediaCaptureInitializationSettings's [SharingMode](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.media.capture.mediacaptureinitializationsettings.sharingmode) property to indicate that they want to run SharedReadOnly if they don't need exclusive control over the photo/video camera. Doing so means the resolution and framerate of the capture will be limited to what other apps have configured the camera to provide.

##### Built-in MRC photo/video camera access

MRC functionality built into Windows 10 (via Cortana, Start Menu, hardware shortcuts, Miracast, Windows Device Portal):
* Will run with ExclusiveControl by default

However, support has been added to each subsystem to operate in a shared mode:
* If an app requests ExclusiveControl access to the photo/video camera, built-in MRC will automatically stop using the photo/video camera so the app's request will succeed
* If built-in MRC is started while an app has ExclusiveControl, built-in MRC will run in SharedReadOnly mode

This shared mode functionality has certain restrictions:
* Photo via Cortana, hardware shortcuts, or Start Menu: Requires the Windows 10 April 2018 Update (or later)
* Video via Cortana, hardware shortcuts, or Start Menu: Requires the Windows 10 April 2018 Update (or later)
* Streaming MRC over Miracast: Requires the Windows 10 October 2018 Update (or later)
* Streaming MRC over Windows Device Portal or via the HoloLens companion app: Requires HoloLens 2

>[!NOTE]
> The resolution and framerate of the built-in MRC camera UI might be reduced from its normal values when another app is using the photo/video camera.

#### MRC access

With the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, there is no longer a limitation around multiple apps accessing the MRC stream (however, the access to the photo/video camera still has limitations).

Previous to the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, an app's custom MRC recorder was mutually exclusive with system MRC (capturing photos, capturing videos, or streaming from the Windows Device Portal).
