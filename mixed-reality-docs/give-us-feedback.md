# Give us feedback

Use the Feedback Hub to tell us which features you love, which features you could do without, or when something could be better.

* Select **Mixed Reality** top category and then pick an applicable sub category:

  |  Subcategory  |  Description | 
  |----------|----------|
  |  Apps  |  Issues with a specific application. | 
  |  Developer  |  Issues in authoring / running an app for Mixed Reality. | 
  |  Device  |  Issues with the HMD itself. | 
  |  Home experience  |  Issues with your VR environment: interactions with the your mixed reality home. | 
  |  Input  |  Issues with input methods: motion controllers, speech, gamepad, or mouse and keyboard. | 
  |  Set up  |  Anything that is preventing you from setting up the device. | 
  |  All other issues  |  Anything else. |
  
* To help us identify and fix the bug faster, capturing traces and video is extremely helpful. To start collecting traces, click on **Start capture**. This will begin collecting traces and a video capture of your mixed reality scenario.<br>

* Leave the Feedback app and run through the broken scenario. Do not close the Feedback Hub app at this point.
* After you are done with your scenario, go back to the feedback app and click **Stop Capture**. Once you do that, you should see that a file containing the traces has been added.
* Click **Submit**.<br>
