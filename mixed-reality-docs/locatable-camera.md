# Locatable camera

HoloLens includes a world-facing camera mounted on the front of the device which enables apps to see what the user sees. Developers have access to and control of the camera just as they would for color cameras on smartphones, portables, or desktops. The same universal windows [media capture](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.media.capture.mediacapture.aspx) and windows media foundation APIs that work on mobile and desktop work on HoloLens. Unity [has also wrapped these windows APIs](locatable-camera-in-unity.md) to abstract simple usage of the camera on HoloLens for tasks such as taking regular photos and videos (with or without holograms) and locating the camera's position in and perspective on the scene.

>[!NOTE]
>Customers can leverage [mixed reality capture](mixed-reality-capture.md) to take videos or photos of your app, which include holograms and video stabilization.
>
>As a developer, there are considerations you should take into account when creating your app if you want it to look as good as possible when a customer captures content. You can also enable (and customize) mixed reality capture from directly within your app. Learn more at [mixed reality capture for developers](mixed-reality-capture-for-developers.md).

## Locating the Device Camera in the World

When HoloLens takes photos and videos, the captured frames include the location of the camera in the world, as well as the lens model of the camera. This allows applications to reason about the position of the camera in the real world for augmented imaging scenarios. Developers can creatively roll their own scenarios using their favorite image processing or custom computer vision libraries.

"Camera" elsewhere in HoloLens documentation may refer to the "virtual game camera" (the frustum the app renders to). Unless denoted otherwise, "camera" on this page refers to the real-world RGB color camera.

The details on thisÂ page cover using the [MediaFrameReference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.capture.frames.mediaframereference) class, however there are also APIs to pull camera intrinsics and locations using [Media Foundation Attributes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/mt740395(v=vs.85).aspx). Please refer to the [Holographic face tracking sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/HolographicFaceTracking) for more information.

### Images with Coordinate Systems

Each image frame (whether photo or video) includes a [SpatialCoordinateSystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.perception.spatial.spatialcoordinatesystem) rooted at the camera at the time of capture which can be accessed using the [CoordinateSystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.capture.frames.mediaframereference.coordinatesystem#Windows_Media_Capture_Frames_MediaFrameReference_CoordinateSystem) property of your [MediaFrameReference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Capture.Frames.MediaFrameReference). In addition, each frame contains a description of the camera lens model which can be found in the [CameraIntrinsics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.capture.frames.videomediaframe.cameraintrinsics#Windows_Media_Capture_Frames_VideoMediaFrame_CameraIntrinsics) property. Together, these transforms define for each pixel a ray in 3D space representing the path taken by the photons that produced the pixel. These rays can be related to other content in the app by obtaining the transform from the frame's coordinate system to some other coordinate system (e.g. from a [stationary frame of reference](coordinate-systems.md#stationary-frame-of-reference)). To summarize, each image frame provides the following:
* Pixel Data (in RGB/NV12/JPEG/etc. format)
* A [SpatialCoordinateSystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.perception.spatial.spatialcoordinatesystem) from the location of capture
* A [CameraIntrinsics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.capture.frames.videomediaframe.cameraintrinsics#Windows_Media_Capture_Frames_VideoMediaFrame_CameraIntrinsics) class containing the lens mode of the camera

### Camera to Application-specified Coordinate System

To go from the 'CameraIntrinsics' and 'CameraCoordinateSystem' to your application/world coordinate system, you'll need the following:

[Locatable camera in Unity](locatable-camera-in-unity.md): CameraToWorldMatrix is automatically provided by PhotoCaptureFrame class(so you don't need to worry about the CameraCoordinateSystem transforms).

[Locatable camera in DirectX](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/HolographicFaceTracking): The Holographic Face Tracking sample shows the fairly straightforward way to query for the transform between the camera's coordinate system and your own application coordinate system(s).

### Distortion Error

On HoloLens, the video and still image streams are undistorted in the system's image processing pipeline before the frames are made available to the application (the preview stream contains the original distorted frames). Because only the CameraIntrinsics are made available, applications must assume image frames represent a perfect pinhole camera.

On HoloLens (first-generation) the undistortion function in the image processor may still leave an error of up to 10 pixels when using the CameraIntrinsics in the frame metadata. In many use cases, this error will not matter, but if you are aligning holograms to real world posters/markers, for example, and you notice a <10px offset (roughly 11mm for holograms positioned 2 meters away) this distortion error could be the cause. 

## Locatable Camera Usage Scenarios

### Show a photo or video in the world where it was captured

The Device Camera frames come with a "Camera To World" transform, that can be used to show exactly where the device was when the image was taken. For example you could position a small holographic icon at this location (CameraToWorld.MultiplyPoint(Vector3.zero)) and even draw a little arrow in the direction that the camera was facing (CameraToWorld.MultiplyVector(Vector3.forward)).

### Tag / Pattern / Poster / Object Tracking

Many mixed reality applications use a recognizable image or visual pattern to create a trackable point in space. This is then used to render objects relative to that point or create a known location. Some uses for HoloLens include finding a real world object tagged with fiducials (e.g. a TV monitor with a QR code), placing holograms over fiducials, and visually pairing with non-HoloLens devices like tablets that have been setup to communicate with HoloLens via Wi-Fi.

To recognize a visual pattern, and then place that object in the applications world space, you'll need a few things:
1. An image pattern recognition toolkit, such as QR code, AR tags, face finder, circle trackers, OCR etc.
2. Collect image frames at runtime, and pass them to the recognition layer
3. Unproject their image locations back into world positions, or likely world rays. See
4. Position your virtual models over these world locations

Some important image processing links:
* [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)
* [QR Tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code)
* [FaceSDK](http://research.microsoft.com/projects/facesdk/)
* [Microsoft Translator](https://www.microsoft.com/translator/business)

Keeping an interactive application frame-rate is critical, especially when dealing with long-running image recognition algorithms. For this reason we commonly use the following pattern:
1. Main Thread: manages the camera object
2. Main Thread: requests new frames (async)
3. Main Thread: pass new frames to tracking thread
4. Tracking Thread: processes image to collect key points
5. Main Thread: moves virtual model to match found key points
6. Main Thread: repeat from step 2

Some image marker systems only provide a single pixel location (others provide the full transform in which case this section will not be needed), which equates to a ray of possible locations. To get to a single 3d location we can then leverage multiple rays and find the final result by their approximate intersection. To do this you'll need to:
1. Get a loop going collecting multiple camera images
2. Find the associated feature points, and their world rays
3. When you have a dictionary of features, each with multiple world rays, you can use the following code to solve for the intersection of those rays:

```
public static Vector3 ClosestPointBetweenRays(
   Vector3 point1, Vector3 normalizedDirection1,
   Vector3 point2, Vector3 normalizedDirection2) {
   float directionProjection = Vector3.Dot(normalizedDirection1, normalizedDirection2);
   if (directionProjection == 1) {
     return point1; // parallel lines
   }
   float projection1 = Vector3.Dot(point2 - point1, normalizedDirection1);
   float projection2 = Vector3.Dot(point2 - point1, normalizedDirection2);
   float distanceAlongLine1 = (projection1 - directionProjection * projection2) / (1 - directionProjection * directionProjection);
   float distanceAlongLine2 = (projection2 - directionProjection * projection1) / (directionProjection * directionProjection - 1);
   Vector3 pointOnLine1 = point1 + distanceAlongLine1 * normalizedDirection1;
   Vector3 pointOnLine2 = point2 + distanceAlongLine2 * normalizedDirection2;
   return Vector3.Lerp(pointOnLine2, pointOnLine1, 0.5f);
 }
```

Given two or more tracked tag locations, you can position a modelled scene to fit the users current scenario. If you can't assume gravity, then you'll need three tag locations. In many cases we use a simple color scheme where white spheres represent real-time tracked tag locations, and blue spheres represent modelled tag locations, this allows the user to visually gauge the alignment quality. We assume the following setup in all our applications:
* Two or more modelled tag locations
* One 'calibration space' which in the scene is the parent of the tags
* Camera feature identifier
* Behavior which moves the calibration space to align the modelled tags with the real-time tags (we are careful to move the parent space, not the modelled markers themselves, because other connect is positions relative to them).

```
// In the two tags case:
 Vector3 idealDelta = (realTags[1].EstimatedWorldPos - realTags[0].EstimatedWorldPos);
 Vector3 curDelta = (modelledTags[1].transform.position - modelledTags[0].transform.position);
 if (IsAssumeGravity) {
   idealDelta.y = 0;
   curDelta.y = 0;
 }
 Quaternion deltaRot = Quaternion.FromToRotation(curDelta, idealDelta);
 trans.rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(deltaRot * trans.forward, trans.up);
 trans.position += realTags[0].EstimatedWorldPos - modelledTags[0].transform.position;
```

### Track or Identify Tagged Stationary or Moving real-world objects/faces using LEDs or other recognizer libraries

Examples:
* Industrial robots with LEDs (or QR codes for slower moving objects)
* Identify and recognize objects in the room
* Identify and recognize people in the room (e.g. place holographic contact cards over faces)
