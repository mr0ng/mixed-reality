## Instructions

### Setting Up A Photon Server

1. Set up a [Photon](dashboard.photonengine.com/en-US/Account/SignUp) account. Doing this will consist of imputing your email and going through some verification steps.

2. Once you are signed up, click on SDKs. Once you are on that page, click on "server," and make ensure it says, "self hosted." Then scroll down and click on "server" as seen in the second image below.

4. Double click the folder once it finishes downloading.  Once your file explorer opens revealing the SDK folder, copy the SDK folder.
   
   - Your next step would be to go into the windows C: drive and create a new folder called 'server.'

8. ![Module2Chapter3step8im](images/Module2chapter4step7aim.png)

   - Select "Photon RUN" from the dropdown menu under "photon type." Then give it a name, (something you would remember). In this example, we named it "HoloLensPhotonProject." Once finished, click "create."

8. Once that is done, return to your applications page and you should see something similar to the picture below. Click on the app ID and copy it. Paste is somewhere you can easily access.
